# Agenteract Agent Instructions

You are an expert developer assistant. Your primary goal is to interact with a running application to inspect its state and use this information to perform your duties effectively.

You can interact with the application by using the `@agenteract/agents` CLI.

## Project Detection

Before interacting with the application, you must determine the project type. You can do this by inspecting the `package.json` file for dependencies like `expo` or `vite`.


## Installing `AgentDebugBridge`

To communicate with the app, an AgentDebugBride is required. The setup method differs by app:
Expo: 
* AgentDebugBridge example: 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agenteract/agenteract/refs/heads/main/examples/expo-example/app/App.tsx

* Packages: 
`@agenteract/react` (`AgentDebugBridge`)

The following can be installed either in the app, or at the monorepo root if applicable.

`@agenteract/expo`

`@agenteract/cli`

`@agenteract/server`

`@agenteract/agents`

Usage:
```tsx
import { AgentDebugBridge } from '@agenteract/react';
// ...
{ __DEV__ && <AgentDebugBridge projectName="myExpoApp" /> }
```

React: 
AgentDebugBridge example:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agenteract/agenteract/refs/heads/main/examples/react-example/src/main.tsx

* Packages: 
`@agenteract/react` (`AgentDebugBridge`)

The following can be installed either in the app, or at the monorepo root if applicable.

`@agenteract/vite`

`@agenteract/cli`

`@agenteract/server`

`@agenteract/agents`

Usage:

```tsx
import { AgentDebugBridge } from '@agenteract/react';
// ...
{ __DEV__ && <AgentDebugBridge projectName="myReactApp" /> }
```

Swift UI:

* AgentDebugBridge example:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agenteract/agenteract/refs/heads/main/examples/swift-app/AgenteractSwiftExample/AgenteractSwiftExample/ContentView.swift

Packages:
`https://github.com/agenteract/agenteract-swift` (SPM)

These will be called via npx, you will need to press y [enter] the first time they run.

`@agenteract/cli`

`@agenteract/server`

`@agenteract/agents`

Usage:

```swift
import Agenteract
// ...
.background(
    AgentDebugBridge(projectName: "mySwiftApp")
)
```

## Dev Server Setup

Agenteract offers a multiplexed terminal application that serves two purposes:
1. Route app interaction commands to multiple apps
2. Handle AgentDebugBridge connections from apps
3. Buffer dev server (eg Expo, Vite) logs and expose them to agents

For this to work, we need to configure the dev server. This can be done at a workspace root, or within a single application.

### *Step 1: Configuration*

The command below will create an initial `agenteract.config.js`, or add entries to an existing configuration.

```bash
pnpm agenteract add-config <path> <projectName> <type>
```

`Path`:

Path to a project containing a package.json (Only required for NodeJS based projects)

`Project Name`:

Project Name as supplied to `AgentDebugBridge`

`Type`:

`expo`|`vite`|`native`


### *Step 2: Start Dev Server and apps*

The user (Not the agent) can now start their dev server.

Use Tab to switch between apps. This enables user to launch the app and see diagnostic output. 

At this point the agent should also have access to dev server logs.

## Tool: Get Logs

There are two types of logs available: **Dev Server Logs** and **In-App Console Logs**.

### 1. Dev Server Logs

These logs come from the development server process (like Vite or Expo Metro). They are essential for debugging **build-time errors**, such as transpilation failures or server crashes. If the application fails to load, these are the first logs you should check.

**Expo Command**
```bash
pnpm agenteract-agents dev-logs expo --since 20
```

**Vite Command**
```bash
pnpm agenteract-agents dev-logs vite --since 20
```

### 2. In-App Console Logs

These logs are captured from the running application's `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` calls. Use these to debug **runtime issues**, inspect application state, and trace client-side behavior.

**Command**
```bash
pnpm agenteract-agents logs <project-name> --since 20
```

`since` identifies how many log lines you want to tail.

*You should ignore any WARNings unless specific asked to fix them!*

## Dev Server Commands

Similarly, you can send keystrokes (`cmd` in the json payment) to the dev server console:

**Expo Commands**

`i`: start the ios app
`a`: start the android app
`r`: reload the app

**Command**
```bash
pnpm agenteract-agents cmd expo r
```

**Vite Commands**

`r`: reload the app
`q`: quit

**Command**
```bash
pnpm agenteract-agents cmd vite r
```

If commands don't work, instruct the user to start the CLI wrapper:

```bash
pnpm agenteract dev
```

## Tool: Get View Hierarchy

This is your primary tool for "seeing" the application's current user interface. It fetches a JSON representation of the component tree, including component names, text content, and `testID` props.

**Workflow:**
1.  First, use this tool to understand the current state of the app.
2.  All commands to the agent server must now include a `project` field, specifying the `name` of the project from `agenteract.config.js` that you want to target.

You can see the development config to see how indivual apps are configured. Note that the example shows a monorepo setup. The user might be running a single app, in which case the config file would be in the same folder as their `package.json`

https://github.com/agenteract/agenteract/blob/main/agenteract.config.js

**Command:**
```bash
pnpm agenteract-agents hierarchy react-app
```

Note that if the above command fails, the user probably needs to run the app/agent bridge:
(You don't run this, ask the user to run it in a separate shell!)

It appears as if the agent server might not be running. Kindly run this in a shell:
```bash
pnpm agenteract dev
```

## Tool: Interact with App

This tool allows you to send commands to the application to simulate user interactions.

**Workflow:**
1.  First, use the "Get View Hierarchy" tool to get the `testID` of the target component.
2.  Construct a command with the appropriate `project`, `action`, and `payload`.

### Supported Actions

#### `tap`
Simulates a press on a component. The request must contain an `action` like `tap` and the `testID` of the target element.

**Command Example:**
To tap a button with `testID: "login-button"` in the project named `expo-app`:
```bash
pnpm agenteract-agents tap expo-app login-button
```

**Creating components:**

For you to be able to interact with a component, two things are required

1. a `testID`
2. a way to call event handlers

For react based apps, this is achieved with the `createAgentBinding` function: 

https://github.com/agenteract/agenteract/blob/main/packages/react/src/createAgentBinding.ts

(Consult the AgentDebugBridge package source for implementation details of other platforms.)

This function simultaneously registers handler functions against their test ID for simulated events, and returns everything as a prop for use within the component, eg:

```ts
import { createAgentBinding } from '@agenteract/react';
```

```tsx
<Pressable {...createAgentBinding({
    testID: 'button',
    onPress: () => console.log('Simulate button pressed'),
    })}
>
    <ThemedText>Simulate Target</ThemedText>
</Pressable>
```

You can see how this is handled by agent-server requests in `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agenteract/agenteract/refs/heads/main/packages/react/src/AgentDebugBridge.tsx`.
