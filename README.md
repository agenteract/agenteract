# Agenteract

Agenteract is a framework that enables agents to interact with apps under development.

Todo
- [ ] Frameworks (Swift UI, Jetpack, nextjs, angular, pure js+dom, more...)
- [ ] Cursor, Calude Code (via MCP)
- [ ] curl - Wrap in node script. This will allow multiplexing based on PWD of process.
- [ ] npx @agenteract/expo drops args
- [ ] @agenteract/expo could be a generic pty wrapper (might make agent instructions difficult to understand)
- [ ] GEMINI.md refers to expo specifically. Instructions should tell agents to see what type of project it is and request pty wrapper to be started
- [ ] Need to be able to talk to different app instances: Probably output an ID and device details which agent then passes with requests
- [ ] Review gemini extension publishing
